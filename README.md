# Python: Space Age

Write a program that, given an age in seconds, calculates how old someone is in terms of a given planet's solar years.

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

   - Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
   - Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
   - Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
   - Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
   - Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
   - Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
   - Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
   - Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should
be able to say that they're 31 Earth-years old.

If you're wondering why Pluto didn't make the cut, go watch [this
youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_2gbGXzFbs).

To run a test file, pass it as an argument to the `python` command:

    python hello_world_test.py

If you want to stop the tests after the first failure, then you can use the pytest library.

Install pytest with pip:

    pip install pytest

Run the tests with the `py.test` command using the `-x` flag to exit after the first failure.

    py.test -x hello_world_test.py
